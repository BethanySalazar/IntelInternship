"""
    Trees - data that's connected through branches, collection of nodes
    Branches - the connection between nodes
    Nodes - structure of data, anything
    Root - The top node in a tree
    Child - A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the Root
    Parent - The converse notion of a child
    Siblings - A group of nodes with the same parent
    Descendant - A node reachable by repeated proceeding from parent to child, only going up
    Ancestor - A node reachable by repeated proceeding from child to parent , directly related
    Leaf - A node with no children
    Internal node - A node with at least one child
    External node - A node with no children
    Degree - The number of sub trees of a node
    Edge - The connection between one node and another
    Path - A sequence of nodes and edges connecting a node with a descendant
    Level - The level of a node is defined by 1 + (the number of connections between the node and the root).
    Height of node - The height of a node is the number of edges on the longest path between that node and a leaf
    Height of tree - The height of a tree is the height of its root node
    Depth - The depth of a node is the number of edges from the node to the tree's root node
    Forest - A forest is a set of n â‰¥ 0 disjoint trees.
